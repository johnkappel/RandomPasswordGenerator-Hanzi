# Random Password Generator - Hanzi
I developed this program to generate a random password in Hanzi.  This program asks the user to input the desired number of characters for a new password, then generates and outputs a random password from a set of 70 Hanzi characters. I wrote this program in Python 3.9.2 with VSCode.
